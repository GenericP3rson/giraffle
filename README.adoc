This plugin creates a dsl for Tigergraph. The dsl allows you to describe
connections to a Tigergraph server.

== Status
The Giraffle plugin is still under development. To use this plugin, you'll
need to publish it to your local maven repository. This is typically is
`~/.m2/repository`. Soon we'll publish this plugin to a Maven repository.

[#development-assistance]
== Development Assistance
Fork and clone this repository. After this you should be able to make changes,
compile, test and publish.  The `publishToMavenLocal` will make the plugin
available to your Gradle projects.

[#plugin-use]
== Using the plugin
In order to use this plugin you'll need to install this plugin and Tigergraph's
gsql client.

To install the gradle plugin, follow the instructions outlined in <<Development
Assistance>>.

To install the gsql client, you'll need to obtain it from your Tigergraph
installation. Once you've obtained the plugin, I find it handy to publish it to
your local Maven repository.

The jar you'll need is the `gsql_client.jar`. Instructions to find it can be
found at
https://docs.tigergraph.com/dev/using-a-remote-gsql-client[Tigergraph's
documentation site]

After obtaining the jar, use Maven's
https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-install-plugin/examples/specific-local-repo.html[install
plugin] to install it in your local repository.

Example:

[source,shell]
----
mvn install:install-file \ # <1>
    -Dfile=./gsql_client.jar \ # <2>
    -DgroupId=com.tigergraph.client \ # <3>
    -DartifactId=Driver \ # <4>
    -Dversion=2.1.7 \ # <5>
    -Dpackaging=jar # <6>
----
<1> The maven command to package and install your code.
<2> The source file for this command.
<3> The group to install this code to.
<4> The name of the artifact we are creating.
<5> The version to create when installing this artifact.
<6> The type of package to create.

At this point you should have 2 jars installed locally. With these installed
you can create your gradle build file that uses the plugin.

init.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
initscript {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal() // <1>
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("com.optum.giraffle:tigergraph-gradle-plugin:0.1.0")
    }
}
----
<1> This is where we've installed this plugin and the Tigergraph gsql client.

build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
plugins {
    id("com.optum.giraffle) version "0.1.0" <1>
}

val tigergraph by configurations.creating // <2>
dependencies {
    tigergraph("com.tigergraph.client:Driver:2.1.7")
}

tigergraph {
    scriptDir.set(file("scripts"))
    tokens.set(emptyMap())
    serverName.set("")
    userName.set("")
    password.set("")
    adminUserName.set("")
    adminPassword.set("")
}
----
<1> Watch this version. You'll need to update it as development proceeds.
<2> This configuration isn't required. The defaults within the plugin provide
this dependency already. However, if you need to override the defaults, this is
how you do that.

This should put everything in order. The plugin defines a couple of tasks, and
a dsl to handle connection parameters to your Tigergraph server(s).

== Plugin DSL and Tasks
The plugin creates a dsl, custom task types, and custom tasks.

=== Tigergraph DSL
The dsl provided by this plugin allow configuration that applies to all the
tasks and types created by the plugin.

[#dsl-components]
==== DSL Components
All the components belong within a `tigergraph` closure. All of these are
properties, and need to be `set` accordingly.

===== scriptDir
The `scriptDir` configuration is a `file` path location for where the gsql
scripts for your project live.

The default value for `scriptDir` is `db_scripts`. It is not necessary to set
this value if you've placed you scripts in this directory already.

Example:
Kotlin

build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
tigergraph {
    scriptDir.set(file("scripts"))
}
----

Example:
Groovy

build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
tigergraph {
    scriptDir = file("scripts")
}
----

===== tokens
This plugin supports token replacement within your source scripts. Internally
it uses an
https://ant.apache.org/manual/api/org/apache/tools/ant/filters/ReplaceTokens.html[Ant
filter]. Simply provide a map as the parameter to this property, and your
sources will have the tokens replaced before execution.

Example:
Kotlin

build.gradl.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
val tokenMap: LinkedHashMap<String, String> = linkedMapOf("graphname" to "hc")

tigergraph {
    tokens.set(tokenMap)
}
----

This configuration will take each occurrence of `@graphname@` and replace it
with the value of `hc` within the source scripts.

===== serverName
The `serverName` property configures which server to execute your scripts against.

Example:
Kotlin

build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
tigergraph {
    serverName.set("dbsw00001")
}
----

===== userName
The `userName` property configures the username to use for connecting to
tigergraph. This is the default username to use. When a script requires
elevated privileges, see <<adminUserName>> and  <<superUser>>.

===== password
The `password` property configures the password to use for connecting to
tigergraph. This is property is used in conjunction with <<userName>>.

===== adminUserName
The `adminUserName` property configures the username to use for connecting to
tigergraph. This is used when the `superUser` property is set on a gsql script.
See <<superUser>>.

===== adminPassword
The `adminPassword` property configures the password to use for connecting to
tigergraph. This is property is used in conjunction with <<adminUserName>>.

=== gsqlCopyTasks
The plugin defines this task, and adds it to the project. This task copies
files from the <<dsl-components,scriptDir>> directory and copies the files to
the project's `buildDir`.

This is the step where token replacement occurs, as defined by the
<<dsl-components,tokens>> property.

=== gsqlTaskType
This defines a task type that allows you to execute your scripts against the
tigergraph server with the properties set by the <<Tigergraph DSL>>

To use this task type you simply need to define the name of the script to
execute, and optionally the <<superUser>> directive.

==== scriptPath
The path, relative to <<dsl-components,scriptDir>> to execute.

==== superUser
The directive that indicates whether this can be executed by the default user
(`false`), or the superUser (`true`).

== Examples
I like using this with plugin in conjunction with the
https://github.com/stevesaliman/gradle-properties-plugin[Properties] plugin.
This allows you to use and configure different environments.

gradle.properties
[source,properties]
----
username=joe
password=joehasabadpassword
host=dbsrv001
graphname=hc
----

build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]

import com.optum.giraffle.tasks.GsqlCopySources
import com.optum.giraffle.tasks.GsqlTask

plugins {
    id("com.optum.giraffle") version "0.1.0"
}

repositories {
    mavenLocal()
    jcenter()
}

val graphname: String by project // <1>
val host: String by project
val username: String by project
val password: String by project
val tokenMap: LinkedHashMap<String, String> = linkedMapOf("graphname" to graphname) // <2>

tigergraph { // <3>
    scriptDir.set(file("db_scripts"))
    tokens.set(tokenMap)
    serverName.set(host)
    userName.set(username)
    password.set(password)
}

val createSchema by tasks.creating(GsqlTask::class) {
    group = "Tigergraph Schema"
    description = "Create the schema on the database"
    scriptPath = "schema.gsql" // <4>
    superUser = true // <5>
}

----
<1> `by project` is how you references project properties using the Kotlin DSL for Gradle.
<2> This is how you create a Kotlin map to pass to a property.
<3> Our Tigergraph DSL. These settings apply for all interactions with Tigergraph.
<4> The path to the source script relative to `scriptDir`.
<5> Informs the plugin which credentials to use.
